            <p>-    This coding project has been a wonderful experience. I never had a passion for IT, but I'm happy I was given this chance to use it to
                show something I'm passionate about. This project could only have been possible with the help of my friends and teacher, Mr. Gibs. -

             -   It may be undeniable that there are boring parts in this shop, but when is this different for any other shop. This project is an example of
             skills you can learn, and more importantly, have fun while learning. Making this project has been challenging, yet rewarding. And most importantly, a blast to do  -
